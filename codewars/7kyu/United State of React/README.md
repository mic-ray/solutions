## Description

You will be given a component called `States`. You will need to establish an initial state for the component called `united` and for it to be set to **false**.

Then write a `unite` function that changes this state to true.

Then conditionally render a bespoke message in the component.

If the States are united then display "Code for everyone".

If the States aren't united then display "Make America code again".
