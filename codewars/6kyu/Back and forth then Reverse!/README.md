## Description

A list S will be given. You need to generate a list T from it by following the given process:

1. Remove the first and last element from the list S and add them to the list T.
2. Reverse the list S
3. Repeat the process until list S gets emptied.

The above process results in the depletion of the list S. Your task is to generate list T **without mutating** the input List S.

**Note:**

- size of S goes up to `10^6`
- Keep the efficiency of your code in mind.
- Do not mutate the Input.


**Example:**

    S = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    T = []

    S = [2,3,4,5] => [5,4,3,2]
    T = [1,6]

    S = [4,3] => [3,4]
    T = [1,6,5,2]

    S = []
    T = [1,6,5,2,3,4]
    return T
